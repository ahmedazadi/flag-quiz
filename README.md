# FLAG QUIZ [visit](https://flag-q.netlify.app/)

A quiz game made with [React](https://create-react-app.dev/). Open the page on the web and you presented a flag of a random country, four choices among which you have to choose one that flag belongs to within 20 seconds. Each time you make a wrong choice, you lose 10 seconds, untill your time is up, then you get your result. Each time you answer correctly you gain 3 points, which later, can be used to some question. 5 points for skipping.

## Technical side

This is a small project, so, I did not use many different technologies, just a few.
[React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/), for some ready components.
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), for styling.
[React-Loading](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loading), for Loading component.
